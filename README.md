# coelho-js

A list of Paulo Coelho quotes from his books

This app was made for [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/).

This project also belongs to #100DaysOfVue initiative.

## Additional used components

+ [Parcel][1] for watch and bundling files.
+ [axios][2] for fetch data to [JEXIA][3]
+ [JEXIA][3] as my always reliable serverless infrastructure! You should try it.
+ [localStore.js][4], an implementation of my own [LocalStorage][5] wrapper.
+ [dotenv][6] files to keep config files and keys apart from the app.

## Learned during the process

1. How to chain Promises with [axios][2].
2. Differences between `created` and `mounted` Vue hooks.
3. [K.I.S.S Principle][7]
4. How to work with [dotenv][6] files.
5. How to config a dataset in [JEXIA][3]
6. How to setup public URLs for assets on [Parcel][1]

Also, I really want to thank you [@ammezie](https://github.com/ammezie) for
[this][8] information about how to make things work with [Parcel][1] and Vue.
You rock, dude!

Last, but not least. I want to thank you [JEXIA][3] for make such an amazing app
and beautiful documentation :)
